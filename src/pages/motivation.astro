        It began on daily carpool rides to the university. My classmates wanted the shortest walk, I wanted the fewest turns â€” and somewhere between their requests and my optimizations, I started seeing nodes, edges, and constraints instead of streets. That small negotiation became the seed of my fascination with networks and efficiency. Years later, it turned into a thesis that pushed me to personal and computational limits: full-time work, two graduate courses, and late-night reinforcement-learning runs until convergence.

      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed text-[1.05rem] text-zinc-300"></p>
        The result â€” networks reduced by almost half while preserving over 90% of the flow â€” reminded me that the algorithms I taught to adapt and endure mirrored my own journey. This project is more than research; itâ€™s proof that resilience, like flow, finds its way through even the most complex networks.
        These networks can be invisible to the naked eye: you might not think that you are standing on a graph node demanding water  from the central source  when you take a shower.

        These networks are huge and a small error could cost millions of dollars. It makes sense that we need to have plan A,B and C.  For example, some bus routes may need to be changed since the streets are going to be closed randomly by the district for the next couple of weeks : some streets on some days .We need to handle the passengers going to different places every day, someone might wanna go to school on Monday, but Tuesday has a dental appointment. So we have a fluctuation on the demand of the routes and of course we have little budget for it. How can we do that on a fancy way? WeÂ´ve got our goal:
